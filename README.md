# Howdy! I'm Rebecca Blitstein 👋
##### You can call me Bec 
___
<br>

### I'm a backend developer with a B.S in Mathematics and Computer Science, and a love for data-driven code. I'm currently based in Buena Vista, Colorado (but you can catch my current location on my *[blog](https://rhblitstein.github.io)*). If you'd like to learn more about some of my work-or play a quick arcade game-head over to my *[portfolio](https://rhblitstein.github.io)*. <br><br>
### When I've stepped away from my computer, you can find me getting lost on trail runs, snuggling my rottweiler, reading beat poetry, or being a true Colorado dirtbag. <br><br>
