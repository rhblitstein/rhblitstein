# Howdy! I'm Rebecca Blitstein 👋🤠
##### You can call me Bec. 
___

### 💻 Full-stack engineer with 5+ years building distributed systems and APIs. B.S. in Math & CS. Currently working with Go, React, PostgreSQL, and whatever else gets the job done.

### 🎮 My portfolio is a pixel-art platformer. Turns out I like building games as much as I like running trails. [Check it out](https://rhblitstein.github.io).

### 🚣 1500+ miles spent floating down the rivers of North America. W-EMT-certified with Swiftwater Rescue training. I flip boats for fun and occasionally get paid for it.

### 🏃 Frolicker of trails at various speeds. Big fan of meandering, lollygagging, and general tomfoolery. Can often be found marveling at local wildlife.

### 🏔️ Living out of my truck in Colorado, chasing rivers and trails. Follow along on [Bec on the Road](https://rhblitstein.github.io/blog) (spoiler alert: I flipped in Sweets Falls). 

### 🐕 Proud owner of a stinky dog. Beat poetry enthusiast. Bukowski reader. Professional at getting lost in the backcountry.
