# Howdy! I'm Rebecca Blitstein 👋🤠
##### You can call me Bec 
___
<br>

### 💻 I'm a backend developer with a B.S in Mathematics and Computer Science, and a love for data-driven code. <br><br>
### 🏔️ I'm currently based in Buena Vista, Colorado (but you can keep up with my current location on my *[blog](https://rhblitstein.github.io)*). If you'd like to learn more about some of my work--or play a quick arcade game--head over to my *[portfolio](https://rhblitstein.github.io)*. <br><br>
### 🚣 When I've stepped away from my computer, you can find me getting lost on trail runs, snuggling my rottweiler, reading beat poetry, or being a true Colorado dirtbag. <br><br>
