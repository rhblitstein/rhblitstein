### 💻 I'm your favorite raft guide's favorite raft guide and a generlist engineer boasting 5+ years of professional experience. I'm a full-stack developer with a B.S in Mathematics and Computer Science, and a love for data-driven code and a penchant for microservice design and API integration. <br><br>
### 🏔️ I'm currently living out of my truck in Colorado (but you can keep up with my current location on my *[blog](https://rhblitstein.github.io)*). If you'd like to learn more about some of my work--or play a quick arcade game--head over to my *[portfolio](https://rhblitstein.github.io)*. <br><br>
### 🚣 When I've stepped away from my computer, you can find me getting lost on trail runs, snuggling my rottweiler, reading beat poetry or Bukowski, or flipping my boat. <br><br>
